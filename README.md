Playground for small personal "scripts" which for whatever reason don't deserve their own repo and Cabal project. Only made public for the purposes of demonstrating the fairly novel build tooling, based around Shake and `cabal install --lib`.

Also functions as an incubator for things which will become separate repositories. Faffing around with dependencies in the early stages of a project is currently cumbersome with Cabal, so it's nice to have a large Stackage-esque set to begin with.
